Description: Posterior maximization for topic models with features that have a
    relative ordering among them.Such a model finds its applications in phylogenetic
    abundance data patterns. This is a modification of the `maptpx` package due to
    Matt Taddy. If you want to take advantage of openmp parallelization, uncomment
    the relevant flags in src/MAKEVARS before compiling.
